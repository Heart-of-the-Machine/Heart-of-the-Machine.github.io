The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the mod is as follows: 
A dimension and a way to get there. The biomes would start out as a reskinned extreme jungle biome, or something like that. Creates the dimension when you activate the first portal. Wasteland, Thinking Forest, Machine Forest would be the first biomes. Maybe some structures, rusted water tanks and buildings, but probably after MVP.
